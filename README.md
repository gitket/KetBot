# KetBot
Ket's discord bot for &lt;Crom>. KetBot monitors members of a discord for twitch streams, and posts messages to a specific channel when a member has gone live. Maybe in the future, KetBot will try and rate people's transmog and display a picture, but for now, just stream monitoring.

KetBot rose from the ashes that was TempleBot once the Netherlight Temple discord was decommissioned. TempleBot was a discord bot to run Simc through discord commands in the cloud before a certain largely known website that does that for you took off. At it's peak, TempleBot served approx 60k people. 

Due to this heritage, it still has some bones from Silkybot 0.9 (the bot TempleBot was forked from), which you can see: https://github.com/troyredfearn/silkybot.

Until I remove pieces not needed, KetBot requires BeautifulSoup and a Blizzard API key (I'm working on removing it :-p)

KetBot also requires Discord.py, a Twitch API key, and a Discord App turned bot

BeautifulSoup can be found: https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/
Discord.py's github is: https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py
Build instructions for simcraft can be found at: https://github.com/simulationcraft/simc/wiki/HowToBuild
To register for a Blizzard API key, go here: https://dev.battle.net/
To get a twitch API key, go here: https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/v5/
To register a Discord app, go here: https://discordapp.com/developers/applications

Further instructions for setting up (at least some of the Discord app stuff) are on the wiki: https://github.com/gitket/TempleBot/wiki/How-to-set-up-TempleBot-for-the-first-time.
